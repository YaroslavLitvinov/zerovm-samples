Wordcount example count words in input files and return words
frequency as output. It's demonstrates using elastic mapreduce library
located at zrt/lib/mapreduce. Use "config" file to setup cluster nodes
count. Application it's a cluster of two kind of nodes : Map, Reduce.
Every Map node read source data via stdin. Reduce node output results
into stdout, also logging files produces for both types of nodes into
stderr if DEBUG macro is enabled.
Example itself implementing folowing list of mandatory functions: Map,
Combine, Reduce, ComparatorMrItem, ComparatorHash, and also optional
function DebugHashAsString for DEBUG mode.
It's demonstrates fixed length value using if VALUE_ADDR_AS_DATA macro
enabled and variable length data using if macro not defined, see 
wordcount/src/user_implem.h, also some another options are available.

use folowing to run from terminal > :
make
./mr_start.sh
