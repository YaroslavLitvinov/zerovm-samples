Distributed Sort
--------------------------------------------
{DOCPATH}

1. Currently by default you can build and run sorting with 10 source and
10 destination nodes; You can run Distributed sort folowing this, in
terminal >
cd $(ZRT_ROOT)/samples/disort
make
./disort.sh

2. Nodes type of disort cluster
2.1main_node - Client of distributed sort that acts as single manager
node, and one instance is required;
2.2src_node - Client of distributed sort that acts as source node, Number
of src nodes can be configured
by SRC_NODES_COUNT from defines.h, at least 3 nodes should be set;
2.3dst_nodes - Same as src_node, but act as destination node with
predefined instances number;

3. Brief info of project contents
 ./disort.sh distributed sort executer
 [disort/manager] Files related to manager node
 [disort/manager/main_man.c] entry point to manager node
 [disort/histanlz.c] it contains functions related to histograms
 analizing
 [disort/comm_man.c] file IO related code  
 
 [disort/source] Source node code files
 [disort/source/main_src.c] entry point to source node
 [disort/source/comm_src.c] file IO related code
 
 [disort/dest] Destionation node code files
 [disort/dest/main_dst.c] entry point to dest node
 [disort/dest/comm_dst.c] file IO related code
 
 [manifest] manifest files of given sample
 [manifest/sortsrc.manifest.template]
 [manifest/sortdst.manifest.template] is template and used by genmanifest.sh script to generate manifests for nodes
 [manifest/sortman.manifest] Manager node manifest
 
4. Logging & Diagramm
Every node doing logging, logs are located in log/ dir.
