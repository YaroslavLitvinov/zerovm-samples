Terasort example it's an implementation of TeraByteSort benchmark on
top of mapreduce library. It sort generated ascii input data and saves
results. Third party applications used from project
http://www.ordinal.com/gensort.html. In order to generate data and
perform testing needed to download gensort & valsort applications and
place it to the zrt/samples/terasort folder.
Cluster consist of two kind of nodes : Map, Reduce. Folowing list of
functions is implemented: Map, Reduce, ComparatorMrItem,
ComparatorHash, and also optional function DebugHashAsString for DEBUG
mode. Combine function not used.
Note that MAP_CHUNK_SIZE environment variable must be set and value
must be multiple on 100, it's simplifies parsing of input. In another
case input data can't be correctly parsed.

use folowing to run from terminal > :
make
./start.sh
