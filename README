Folowing samples demonstrates of usage and building for ZRT:
1.samples/tarimage - Nvram usage demo. User specifying tarball archive
and using nvram mechanism image contents are injecting into user file
system and listing it by readdir;
2.samples/zshell - run lua scripts and sql queries via single zerovm
executable and various manifest files. also available python
scripting;
3.samples/wordcount - distributed application that uses mapreduce and
networking libraries. It calculates count of words in provided input
files; One file per one map node using by design; 3.samples/disort -
distributed sort, 3 kind of applications source,destination, manager
that interacts as nodes, and implements networking communication;
Local sort uses high performance bitonic sort for sse41 instructions
set, or qsort from c std library for another cpu instructions
set. Currently network organized by 10 source, 10 destination and one
manager nodes. Count of nodes and amount of sorting data are possible
to config. Source data generates by generator application, and should
be run separatedly from sorting job;
4.samples/reqrep - this example uses network facility, it's emulate
simple network, where two nodes is communicating one to one. Can work
in two modes. mode 1 - Single node sending N MB and recevies the same
from another node. mode 2- one node sends and another node receives
data in cycle;
5.samples/hello - simple example how to write a program for zerovm.
6.samples/sort_paging - high performance sort contains 3 programs
which allows to create random data, sort it and test sort order. from
this example you can see how to use intrinsics under zerovm -
absolutely same as usual. also this is another example of pagination
mechanism usage. Doing check for sse41.
7.samples/time - via zerovm api user program can get date/time
specified in environment variable"TimeStamp". If there is no such env
var then user program will get -1 (1969-12-31 time = 23:59:59 UTC)
